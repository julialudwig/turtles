"""
Test script for Assignment A4

This test script is different from previous test scripts, because the output
of the functions in A4 is graphical. We cannot use assert_equals to verify
that the turtle is drawing correctly. Instead, we have to let the Turtle draw,
look at the result, and manually verify that they are correct.  Hence the test
procedures for A4 are procedures that draw one or more pictures using the
function being tested.

However, there are some things that we can test automatically. Many of the
functions in A4 require that we restore the state of a turtle when we are done.
We can use assert_equals to verify that these values are properly restored.
We can also use the new function assert_error to verify that a precondition is
being enforced (e.g. an error is raised if the precondition is violated).
There are examples of both of these in this file.

This is an EXTREMELY incomplete test script. We do not guarantee that we have
tested all possibilities for all functions (and in some cases have intentionally
avoided doing so). Passing this script is not a guarantee that you will get a
perfect on the assignment. It is up to you add more tests to ensure that your
A4 functions are complete and correct.

With that said, you will not be submitting this file as part of the assignment.
We have provided it simply as a convenience.
