# Using Turtles!
This project uses the LOGO Turtle to draw various, increasingly complicated shapes.
Code was implemented in a4.py by me. Specifications and test cases in a4test.py were provided by Walker White.
To see application in action, run a4test.py, and follow the prompts on the command line. I suggest using pen speed 0 to skip most turtle animation to see finished shapes or 10 to see it moving quickly.
This project uses the introcs packages found here: https://github.com/WalkerWhite/introcs-python.
